	<p>
	  Debian currently supports two Python stacks, one for Python 3
	  and one for Python 2.  The long term goal for Debian is to
	  reduce this to one stack, dropping the Python 2 stack at some
	  time.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <url id="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0404/"
	  name="PEP 404"> states that no more major Python 2 releases
	  are planned, although the latest released minor version 2.7
	  will see some extended support, documented in
	  <url id="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/"
	  name="PEP 466">.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Packages in Debian should use Python 3 if Python 3 is
	  supported.  New packages should use Python 3 from the initial
	  upload, new upstream versions for existing packages should
	  use Python 3 if the new upstream version supports it.
	</p>

	<p><enumlist>
	  <item>
	    <p>
	      Programs should use Python 3, and should not be packaged
	      for Python 2 as well.  Python 3 should be used for the
	      packaging if the packaging scripts use Python.
	    </p>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <p>
	      Python libraries, if they support Python 3, should be always
	      packaged for Python 3. If an application supports only Python
	      2, the Python libraries for that application should also be
	      packaged for Python 2.

	<heading>Versions</heading>
	<p>
	  At any given time, the binary package <package>python3</package>
	  will represent the current default Debian Python 3 version; the
	  binary package <package>python</package> will represent the
	  current default Debian Python 2 version. As far as is reasonable,
	  Python 3 and Python 2 should be treated as separate runtime
	  systems with minimal interdependencies.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In some cases, Python policy explicitly references Python helper
	  tools. For Debian Stretch, the <package>dh-python</package>
	  package provides the only such tools; earlier helpers have been
	  removed from Debian.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It is a design goal to fully specify required interfaces and
	  functions in policy for Python 3 and to avoid enshrining specific
	  implementation details in policy. Except as noted, policy for
	  Python 2 is the same as Python 3 with the exception of the
	  different major version number as needed to distinguish them.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The default Debian Python version, for each of Python 3 and Python
	  2, should always be the latest stable upstream version that can be
	  fully integrated in Debian.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There may be newer supported or unsupported versions included in
	  Debian if they are not fully integrated for a particular release.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Apart from the default version, legacy versions of Python or beta
	  releases of future upstream versions may be included as well in
	  Debian, as long as they are needed by other packages, or as long
	  as it seems reasonable to provide them.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Note: For the scope of this document, a Python version is
	  synonymous with all micro versions within that minor version. e.g.
	  Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1 are micro versions of the same Python
	  version 3.5, but Python 3.4 and 3.5 are indeed different versions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For any version, the main binary package must be called
	  <package>python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></package>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The set of currently supported Python 3 versions can be found
	  in <file>/usr/share/python3/debian_defaults</file>; the supported
	  interface to this information is
	  through <prgn>/usr/bin/py3versions</prgn>.
	  The set of currently supported Python 2 versions can be found in
	  <file>/usr/share/python/debian_defaults</file>; the supported
	  interface to this information is <prgn>/usr/bin/pyversions</prgn>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  These files are in Python <tt>configparser</tt> format. They
	  define (in the <tt>DEFAULT</tt> section) the following options:
	  <list>
	    <item><tt>default-version</tt>: The name of the interpreter for
	      the current default Debian Python.</item>
	    <item><tt>supported-versions</tt>: The set of interpreter names
	      currently supported and for which modules should be built and
	      byte-compiled. This includes <tt>default-version</tt>.</item>
	    <item><tt>old-versions</tt>: The set of interpreter names which
	      might still be on the system but for which modules should not
	      be built.</item>
	    <item><tt>unsupported-versions</tt>: The set of interpreter
	      names which should not be supported at all, that is modules
	      should not be built or byte-compiled for these. This includes
	      (is a superset of) <tt>old-versions</tt>.</item>

	<p>
	  By default, Python modules are searched in the directories listed
	  in the <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> environment variable and in
	  the <tt>sys.path</tt> Python variable. For all supported Debian
	  releases, <tt>sys.path</tt> does not include
	  a <file>/usr/lib/python<var>X</var><var>Y</var>.zip</file> entry.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Directories with private Python modules must be absent from the
	  <tt>sys.path</tt>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Public Python 3 modules must be installed in the system Python 3
	  modules directory, <file>/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages</file>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Public Python 2 modules must be installed in the system Python 2
	  modules directory
	  <file>/usr/lib/python2.<var>Y</var>/dist-packages</file>, where
	  2.<var>Y</var> is the Python 2 version.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A special directory is dedicated to public Python modules
	  installed by the local administrator,
	  <file>/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages</file> for all Python 3 versions,
	  <file>/usr/local/lib/python2.<var>Y</var>/dist-packages</file> for
	  Python 2.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For local installation of Python modules by the system
	  administrator, special directories are reserved. The
	  directory <file>/usr/local/lib/python3/site-packages</file> is in
	  the Python 3 runtime module search path. The
	  directory <file>/usr/local/lib/python2.<var>Y</var>/site-packages</file>
	  is in the Python 2.<var>Y</var> runtime module search path.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Additional information on appending site-specific paths to the
	  module search path is available in the official documentation of
	  the <tt>site</tt> module.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Python modules which work with multiple supported Python 2
	  versions must install to version-specific locations, for instance
	  <file>/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/foo.py</file> and
	  <file>/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/foo.py</file>. These should
	  point to a common file.

	<p>
	  Architecture-independent public Python 3 modules must be installed
	  to <file>/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages</file>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Architecture-independent public Python 2 modules should be
	  installed to <file>/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages</file>. The
	  historical location for this was <file>/usr/share/pyshared</file>.
	  Since Python 2.7 is the last Python 2 version and the only

	  location is sufficient.

      <p>
	The goal of these policies is to reduce the work necessary for
	Python transitions. Python modules are internally very dependent on
	a specific Python version. However, we want to automate recompiling
	modules when possible, either during the upgrade itself
	(re-compiling bytecode files <file>*.pyc</file>
	and <file>*.pyo</file>) or shortly thereafter with automated
	rebuilds (to handle C extensions). These policies encourage
	automated dependency generation and loose version bounds whenever
	possible.
      <sect>
	<heading>Types of Python Modules</heading>
	<p>
	  There are two kinds of Python modules, "pure" Python
	  modules, and extension modules. Pure Python modules are
	  Python source code that generally works across many versions of
	  Python. Extensions are C code compiled and linked against a
	  specific version of the Python runtime, and so can only
	  be used by one version of Python.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Debian Python does not link extensions to <file>libpython</file>
	  (as is done in some operating systems). Symbols are resolved by
	  <file>/usr/bin/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></file> which is not
	  linked to <file>libpython</file>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Python packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace
	  by using “dotted module names”. See
	  <url id="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package"
	  name="Python's glossary"> for details on how packages are defined
	  in Python terms (a package in the Python sense is unrelated to a
	  Debian package). Python packages must be packaged into the same
	  directory (as done by upstream). Splitting components of a package
	  across directories changes the import order and may confuse
	  documentation tools and IDEs.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are two ways to distribute Python modules. Public modules
	  are installed in a public directory as listed in <ref id="paths">.
	  They are accessible to any program. Private modules are installed
	  in a private directory such
	  as <file>/usr/share/<var>package-name</var></file>
	  or <file>/usr/lib/<var>package-name</var></file>. They are
	  generally only accessible to a specific program or suite of
	  programs included in the same package.

      <sect id="wheels">
	<heading>Wheels</heading>
	<p>
	  <url id="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/"
	       name="PEP 427">
	  defines a built-package format called "wheels", which is a Zip
	  format archive containing Python code and
	  a <file>*.dist-info</file> metadata directory, in a single file
	  named with the <file>.whl</file> suffix. As Zip files, wheels
	  containing pure Python can be put on sys.path and modules in the
	  wheel can be imported directly by Python's <tt>import</tt>
	  statement. (Importing extension modules from wheels is not yet
	  supported as of Python 3.4.)
	</p>
	<p>
	  Except as described below, packages must not build or provide
	  wheels. They are redundant to the established way of providing
	  Python libraries to Debian users, take no advantage of
	  distro-based tools, and are less convenient to use. E.g. they must
	  be explicitly added to <tt>sys.path</tt>, cannot be easily
	  grepped, and stack traces through Zip files are more difficult to
	  debug.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A very limited set of wheel packages are available in the archive,
	  but these support the narrow purpose of enabling
	  the <prgn>pip</prgn>, <prgn>virtualenv</prgn>,
	  and <prgn>pyvenv</prgn> tools in a Debian policy compliant way.
	  These packages build their own dependent wheels through the use of
	  the <prgn>dirtbike</prgn> "rewheeling" tool, which takes installed
	  Debian packages and turns them back into wheels.  Only universal

	  Public Python modules must be packages separately by major Python
	  version, to preserve run time separation between Python 2 and
	  Python 3.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Public Python 3 modules used by other packages must have their
	  binary package name prefixed with <package>python3-</package>.
	  Public Python 2 modules used by other packages must have their
	  binary package name prefixed with <package>python-</package>.
	  It is recommended to use this prefix for all packages with public
	  modules as they may be used by other packages in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The binary package for module <var>foo</var> should preferably be
	  named <package>python3-<var>foo</var></package> (for Python 3)
	  or <package>python-<var>foo</var></package> (for Python 2), if the
	  module name allows. This is not required if the binary package
	  installs multiple modules, in which case the maintainer shall
	  choose the name of the module which best represents the package.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For subpackages such as <var>foo.bar</var>, the recommendation is
	  to name the binary
	  package <package>python3-<var>foo.bar</var></package> (for Python
	  3) or <package>python-<var>foo.bar</var></package> (for Python 2).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Such a package should support the current Debian Python version,
	  and more if possible (there are several tools to help implement
	  this, see <ref id="packaging_tools">). For example, if Python 3.3,
	  3.4, and 3.5 are supported, the Python statement
	  <example>
import foo
	  </example>
	  should import the module when the program interpreter is any
	  of <prgn>/usr/bin/python3.3</prgn>, <prgn>/usr/bin/python3.4</prgn>,
	  and <prgn>/usr/bin/python3.5</prgn>. This requirement also applies
	  to extension modules; binaries for all the supported Python
	  versions should be included in a single package.

	  The <file>debian/control</file> source paragraph may contain
	  optional fields to specify the versions of Python the package
	  supports.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The optional <tt>X-Python3-Version</tt> field specifies the

	</p>
	<p>
	  Similarly, the optional fields <tt>X-Python-Version</tt>
	  or <tt>XS-Python-Version</tt> were used to specify the versions of
	  Python 2 supported by the source package. They are obsolete and
	  can be removed now that only Python 2.7 is supported.
	</p>
	<p>
	  These fields are used by some packaging scripts to automatically
	  generate appropriate Depends and Provides lines. The format of the

	  <example>
X-Python3-Version: &gt;= X.Y
X-Python3-Version: &gt;= A.B, &lt;&lt; X.Y
XS-Python-Version: A.B, X.Y
XS-Python-Version: all
	  </example>
	</p>
	<p>
	  The keyword <tt>all</tt> means that the package supports any
	  Python 2 version available but might be deprecated in the future
	  since using version numbers is clearer than <tt>all</tt> and
	  encodes more information. The keyword <tt>all</tt> is limited to
	  Python 2 versions and must be ignored for Python 3 versions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A comma-separated list of multiple individual versions
	  (e.g. <tt>3.3, 3.4, 3.5</tt>) in <tt>XS-Python-Version</tt> will
	  continue to be supported, but is not recommended. The use of
	  multiple individual versions in <tt>X-Python-Version</tt>
	  or <tt>X-Python3-Version</tt> is not supported for Wheezy and
	  later releases.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The keyword <tt>current</tt> has been deprecated and used to mean
	  that the package would only have to support a single Python 2
	  version (even across default version changes). It must be ignored
	  for Python 3 versions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The use of <tt>XB-Python-Version</tt> in the binary package
	  paragraphs of <file>debian/control</file> file has been deprecated
	  and should be removed in the normal course of package updates. It
	  never achieved sufficient deployment to support its intended

	  Any package that installs modules for the default Python version
	  (or many versions including the default) as described
	  in <ref id="package_names">, must declare a dependency on the

	</p>
	<p>
	  Any package that installs Python modules or Python 3 binary
